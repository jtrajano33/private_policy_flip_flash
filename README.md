#Flipflash: JLPT N4 Flashcards
Welcome to Flipflash: JLPT N4 Flashcards app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Justin Trajano focus on helping users on their Japanese studies on learning/memorizing Kanji. The he app is available on Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trojan.flipflash.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personal identifiable information. This app is offline and is intended only for learning Japanese Kanji so there is no need to gather any of your data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
