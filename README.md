# **Saikou: JLPT N5 N4 Flashcards**

Welcome to Saikou: JLPT N5 N4 Flashcards app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Justin Trajano that focuses on helping users on their Japanese studies in learning/memorizing Kanji. The app is available on Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trojan.flipflash.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personal identifiable information. This app is offline and is intended only for learning Japanese Kanji so there is no need to gather any of your data.

If you find any security vulnerability, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email at justin.trajano32@gmail.com and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, <br />
